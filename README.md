# Tensorflow Dense DNN on MNIST Data

## Generalized ML process
1. Read training & validation datasets
2. Define the neural net architecture and configs
3. Define the loss function
4. Define the optimizer algorithm
5. Train the neural net on batches of data
6. Evaluate the net's performance on the validation dataset
